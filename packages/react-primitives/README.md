##

Internal package with UI primitives for React.

TODO:

- use the `exports` field in `package.json` to define a public API
- `*.css.ts` modules will have to be referenced directly in the consuming app

### Theme

Imported directly

### Public interface

Use exports to define what can be imported from the top level VS a direct import from a nested path.

### Build

Consuming app is responsible for building the bundle.

### Text

Text primitives are implemented here, translations are implemented in the consuming app.
