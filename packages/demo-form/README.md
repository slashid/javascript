# demo-form

This is an internal package - not intended to be published. Various apps in the `/apps` folder are going to use this form to demonstrate the abilities of the `/id` SDKs.

## Development

Powered by [Turborepo internal packages](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/handbook/sharing-code/internal-packages).
Dependend apps should implement their own global styles - [example](../../apps/react-nextjs/styles/globals.css).
